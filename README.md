# spotify-rooms

Web application leveraging Spotify's API that allows different users to add to one queue. Perfect for parties or get togethers where one person is playing the music off their phone, but others want to be able to add songs.

The owner would create a room and allow others to add songs (pending approval by the room owner, of course).

## Getting started
